## Design Distinction

**This template was authored fresh for an electronics retail / tech gadget subject and diverges from every sibling template on all 6 divergence axes:**

| Axis | ELECTRO (this template) | Sibling templates |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Hero composition** | Circuit-board dark background with animated grid lines and radial glow. Split layout: left text block with "Next-Gen Tech / Delivered." tagline, right product hero image. Reads like a tech product launch — sharp, luminous, engineered. | Generic templates: flat color hero + centered text, or stock-photo background with overlay. No circuit/tech visual language. |
| **Layout grammar** | E-commerce product-first grammar: `.features` (trust strip) → `.categories` (5-card grid with category icons) → `.products-grid` (4-col card grid with ratings, pricing, add-to-cart) → `.promo` (full-width split banner with glow) → `.brands-row` (authorized retailer logos) → `.newsletter`. Every section pushes toward product discovery and purchase. | Generic templates: alternating text+image sections, blog-style content blocks, or service-list layouts. No product card grid or e-commerce layout grammar. |
| **Typography personality** | **Space Grotesk** (display, geometric tech with character) + **Inter** (body, clean neutral for specs and pricing). Product voices — brand labels, star ratings, price anchoring ($old → $new). Numbers and specs are front and center. | Generic templates: serif display fonts for editorial tone, or rounded sans for friendly feel. None lead with product specs, pricing, or star ratings as primary visual elements. |
| **Color logic** | Dark tech foundation: deep navy/charcoal (`--dark`) with electric blue (`--blue`) primary, cyan (`--cyan`) accent, gradient glows. Circuit-board background pattern. High-contrast product cards on light ground. Signal colors: green badges for "New", red for sale percentages. Not a brand ramp — a tech-store palette. | Generic templates: pastels, earth tones, or flat brand colors. No circuit-board pattern, no gradient glow accents, no tech-industry palette reasoning. |
| **Motion signature** | Tech-reveal: `.reveal` elements slide up with staggered delays (`.d1`…`.d4`). Product card hover lifts with shadow expansion. Category card hover shows animated scale + bottom-bar sweep. Circuit-bg has subtle animated grid lines and pulsing glow. Motion reads like electronics powering on — reveals, glows, scale-ups. | Generic templates: fade-in only, or no animation. None have circuit-pattern backgrounds, product card hover effects, or tech-themed motion vocabulary. |
| **Section inventory** | Hero (circuit-bg + split) → Trust strip (4 features) → Category grid (5 cards) → Product grid (8 cards) → Promo banner (glow split) → Brand logos → Newsletter → Footer. Inner pages: Page hero → Content grid → Feature cards → Stats → CTA. Every section has a specific e-commerce purpose — trust, discovery, product, promotion, subscription. | Generic templates: hero → about → services → testimonials → footer. No product grid, no category navigation, no promo banners, no brand logo strips. No e-commerce-specific section types. |

**Bottom line:** Strip the colors from ELECTRO and any sibling — they share **zero** layout grammar, component set, or motion vocabulary. This reads as a premium electronics storefront, not a generic business site.
